description: An overview of chat panels in Limbo
---

Chat panels are _panels_ that appear next to a chat in the Limbo UI. The chat and panel are separated by a horizontal split.

Chat panels are used by plugins like [Artifacts](https://github.com/limbo-chat/plugin-artifacts) to display artifacts.

## Registering a Chat Panel

```ts
type CounterData = {
	initialCount: number;
};

limbo.ui.registerChatPanel({
	id: "counter",
	component: ({ data }: limbo.ui.ChatPanelComponentProps<CounterData>) => {
		const [count, setCount] = useState(data.initialCount);

		return (
			<div className="counter">
				<button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}>
					Count: {count}
				</button>
			</div>
		)
	},
});
```

## Presenting a Chat Panel

A Chat Panel can be presented to the user using the `limbo.ui.showChatPanel` function. This presents the chat panel for the currently active chat.

```ts
limbo.ui.showChatPanel({
	id: "counter",
	data: {
		initialCount: 5,
	},
});
```

## Recommendations

- Use kebab case for chat panel IDs (e.g, `artifact-preview`)
- Semantic class names should be used in the component for styling purposes.
