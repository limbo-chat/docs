description: An overview of chat nodes in Limbo
---

Chat nodes are the main pieces of content that appear in the UI and are passed to LLMs for processing.

In Limbo, these are the all of the chat node types that are built in.

- `text`
- `markdown`
- `tool_call`

Each of these chat nodes is a structured data type that contains specific fields and properties. They also all appear in the UI in their own distict ways.

## Serialization

All chat nodes are serialized and stored locally.

Here is an example of a serialized text node as JSON:

Here is the shape of a text node as a JSON object:

```json
{
	"type": "text",
	"data": {
		"content": "Hello, world!"
	}
}
```

## Registering Chat Nodes

Refer to [this guide](./guides/building-a-chat-node) for a more in-depth walkthrough.

```ts
// plugin.ts

import * as limbo from "@limbo-chat/api";

export default {
	onActivate: async () => {
		limbo.ui.registerChatNode({
			id: "my_custom_node",
			component: ({ node }) => {
				return <div>here is a custom node! {node.data.content}</div>;
			},
		});
	},
} satisfies limbo.Plugin;
```

## Recommendations

- use snake case (e.g, my_custom_node) for the chat node ID
- Do not use spaces or special characters in the chat node ID
- Keep the chat node ID short and descriptive (e.g, "text", "markdown", "tool_call", "json", etc)

## The `text` node

The chat node `text` is the most ubiquitous in Limbo, since all LLMs understand text. When dealing with an LLM that doesn't _understand_ a certain node, you should almost always convert it to `text`.
