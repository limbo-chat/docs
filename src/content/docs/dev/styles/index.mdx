Limbo allows developers to create their own custom styles using CSS! It's as simple as placing CSS files in your installation's styles directory.

## Hot Reloading

To enable hot reloading of custom styles, go to the development menu in your settings and enable "Developer mode". _You may need to restart the app for the change to take effect_.

With developer mode enabled, you can see the changes in real time.

## Best Practices

### Use SCSS

_Or any compiled CSS solution_

**Why?**

Using something like SCSS allows you to take advantage of features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making your styles more maintainable and easier to work with.

It also has the advantage of allowing you to compile multiple `scss` files into one single `css` file, allowing much simpler distribution to users.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to create a new Limbo theme is using `create-limbo-theme`, which sets up everything for you. To create a new theme, run:

<NpmCreate scriptName="limbo-theme" />

## Continuous Improvement

Building an application with zero styles and purely semantic CSS can be **hard**. If you're a semantic CSS expert and you see flaws in the way Limbo does things in the markup, please reach out.

It is an ongoing effort to make Limbo 100% customizable, and help from the community is greatly appreciated!
