The recommended way to create a Limbo plugin is with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- A code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Step 1: Create a new plugin

The quickest way to create a new TypeScript Limbo plugin is using `create-limbo-plugin`, which sets up everything for you. To create a new plugin, run:

<NpmCreate scriptName="limbo-plugin" />

After running the command, `create-limbo-plugin` will prompt you for a few details about your plugin, such as its name and description. Once you answer these questions, it will create a new directory with the plugin's files.

Your plugin direcory will look something like this:

<FileTree>
- src
	- plugin.ts the main plugin file
- plugin.json the plugin **manifest**
- tsconfig.json the TypeScript configuration
- rollup.config.js the bundler configuration
- package.json

</FileTree>

## Step 2: Develop your plugin

Inside of your plugin directory, run the following command to start the bundler and watch for changes:

<NpmRun scriptName="dev" />

<Aside>

The bundler used by `create-limbo-plugin` is [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

Our `rollup-plugin-limbo` plugin will copy your built plugin to the Limbo plugins directory, which allows plugins to be automatically reloaded in the app during development!

### Step 3: Enable the plugin

1. Open Limbo, open **settings**
2. Go to the **plugins** tab in the sidebar.
3. Enable your plugin by clicking its toggle.

Your plugin should now be active! You can check the console and you should see a message indicating that your plugin has been activated.
