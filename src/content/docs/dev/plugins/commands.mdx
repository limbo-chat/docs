description: An overview of the command API in Limbo
---

The Limbo API provides a way for plugins to register commands the user can execute from the Command Palette.

Some examples of commands might be to:

- Reload tools from an MCP server
- Reload models from a server like Ollama

## Usage

```ts {7-17}
// plugin.ts

import * as limbo from "@limbo-chat/api";

export default {
	onActivate: async () => {
		limbo.commands.register({
			id: "reload-tools",
			name: "Reload tools",
			execute: async () => {
				const newTools = await fetchToolsFromMCPServer();

				for (const tool of newTools) {
					// ...register tool with the Limbo API
				}
			},
		});
	},
} satisfies limbo.Plugin;
```

## Recommendations

- Use kebab case for command IDs (e.g, `reload-tools`)
- Use descriptive names for your commands to make them easily identifiable.
