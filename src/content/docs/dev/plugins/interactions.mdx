There are several types of interactions that plugins can present to the user.

## Confirmation Dialogs

A confirmation dialog is an interaction presented to a user prompting them to confirm or deny some request. Confirmation dialogs are commonly seen for **destructive** actions.

```ts
const shouldArchiveArtifact = await limbo.ui.showConfirmDialog({
	title: "Archive Artifact?",
	description: "Are you sure you want to archive this artifact?",
});

// destructive confirmation dialog
const shouldDeleteArtifact = await limbo.ui.showConfirmDialog({
	style: "destructive",
	title: "Delete Artifact?",
	description: "Are you sure you want to delete this artifact?",
});

// with custom labels
const shouldArchiveArtifact = await limbo.ui.showConfirmDialog({
	title: "Archive Artifact?",
	description: "Are you sure you want to archive this artifact?",
	confirmLabel: "Archive",
	cancelLabel: "NO!!!",
});
```

## Notifications

Notifications can be presented to the user to notify them of important events or updates.

```ts
limbo.ui.showNotification({
	level: "info",
	title: "Test Notification",
	message: "This is a test notification",
});
```
