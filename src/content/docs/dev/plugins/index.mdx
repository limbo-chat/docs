<Aside>
	The plugin API is **versioned separately** from the Limbo app. The latest version of the Limbo
	app will be built with the latest version of the plugin API.
</Aside>

Plugins are JavaScript modules that extend the existing functionality in Limbo. Plugins interact with limbo by utilizing the Limbo plugin API.

- register custom models
- register custom tools
- register commands
- register custom views with React
- hook into app lifecycles
- and much more...

Limbo is built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and plugins are executed in the [renderer process](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-renderer-process). This means that plugins have access to the browser APIs such as the document.

Plugins **activatedSHOULD** avoid interacting with the browser APIs and use the API provided by Limbo **as much as possible**. A mobile version of Limbo is on the roadmap and plugins that use browser APIs may cause the plugin to be unusable.

## TypeScript

The Limbo plugin API is written in TypeScript, therefore plugins should also be written in TypeScript. This ensures that plugins can take advantage of type checking when using the Limbo plugin API.

## Example

Here's an example of what a Limbo plugin may look like.

```ts
// plugin.ts

import * as limbo from "@limbo-chat/api";

export default {
	onActivate: async () => {
		console.log("Plugin activated!");
	},
	onDeactivate: async () => {
		console.log("Plugin deactivated!");
	},
} satisfies limbo.Plugin;
```
