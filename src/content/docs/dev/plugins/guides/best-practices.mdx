## Tip: Use TypeScript

The Limbo plugin API is built with TypeScript. Using TypeScript for developing plugins allows typesafe interactions with the Limbo plugin API.

## Tip: Use a bundler

Limbo plugins loaded by the app must be in this format:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- my-plugin/
	- plugin.js the main js file
	- plugin.json the plugin **manifest**
</FileTree>

As you start creating more complex plugins that need to use libraries, you will likely want to start using a bundler like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). We've created a [rollup-plugin-limbo](https://github.com/limbo-llm/rollup-plugin) which makes it easy to bundle your plugin with Rollup.

<Aside>
	While [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a great tool, it is not recommended for creating Limbo
	plugins. Vite ships with a lot of features that are not needed for creating Limbo plugins.
