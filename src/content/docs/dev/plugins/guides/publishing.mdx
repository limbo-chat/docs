GitHub releases are used to distribute Limbo plugins. 

A registry of approved community plugins is on the [Roadmap](/roadmap), but as of <LatestAppVersionBadge />, plugins are installed in the app using the GitHub repository URL. 

## Step 1: Build your plugin for production

Your final plugin should be a single directory.

<FileTree>
- my-plugin/
	- plugin.js the main js file
	- plugin.json the plugin **manifest**
</FileTree>

Refer to the [Building your plugin](./building) and [Best practices](./best-practices) guides before publishing your plugin.

## Step 2: Create a release on GitHub

<Steps>
	1. Go to your plugin's GitHub repository and click on the "Releases" tab. 

	2. Click on "Draft a new release".

	3. The release tag **must follow** [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). For example, a valid tag would be `1.0.0`. *You can name the title whatever you want, but a good title would be the same as the tag, e.g. `1.0.0` or `v1.1.0`.* 

	4. Add the `plugin.json` and `plugin.js` files to the release. 

	5. Click on "Publish release".
</Steps>

## Conclusion

Your plugin is now published and should be able to be installed in the Limbo app!
