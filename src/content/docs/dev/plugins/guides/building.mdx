It is recommended to use a bundler such as [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for building Plugins. Bundlers allow you to build your plugin of multiple files and libraries into one single file.

## External libraries

Since the Limbo desktop app already uses certain libraries, they can be access by plugins without needing to bundle them.

As of <LatestAppVersionBadge />, the following libraries **should be excluded** by your bundler if you are using them:

- `@limbo-chat/api`
- `react`
- `react/jsx-runtime`
- `@tanstack/react-query`
- `@sinclair/typebox`

<Aside>
	Libraries like `react` are very large. Since they are already included in the Limbo app, bundling them with your plugin would unnecessarily increase the size of your plugin.

    Using the version of `react` built into the Limbo app also ensures that your plugin is compatible with the version used by the app.

</Aside>

### External libraries with Rollup

```js {6}
// rollup.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "rollup";

export default defineConfig({
	// all of these libraries will be excluded from the bundle
	external: ["limbo", "react", "react/jsx-runtime"],
});
```
